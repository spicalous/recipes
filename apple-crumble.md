# Instructions
- Heat oven to 190C/170 fan/gas 5.
- Mix sliced apples with 2 tbsp golden caster sugar and put in baking dish at least 5cm deep.

- Slice in 110g cold butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like moist breadcrumbs. (Shake bowl to find big bits)
- Pour the crumb mix over apples, use fork to even out.
- Gently press surface with back of fork so crumble holds together.
- Lightly drag fork over the top for decorative finish.

- Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
